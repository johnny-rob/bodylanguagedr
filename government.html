      <h2>Service Capabilities</h2>
      <p>Registered and active in the SAM database
        (accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov)  We help employees
        learn, grow, and develop into effective leaders/managers within their
        department.
      </br>
        We seek to meet the needs of government agencies to develop their
        greatest asset, their people. Our services target training, management,
        education, and leadership needs. As a small, woman owned business, we
        understand organization and individual strengths and challenges within
        different agencies ... but understand that all have high expectations
        and outcomes.
      </br>
        Doing business with government agencies is an important part of our
        company. We bid on and provide services under government contracts on
        a regular basis. Of course, our conduct and services adhere to all
        security regulations and are implemented with professionalism and
        integrity.
      </br>
        Accountability Measures is registered in sam.gov as both a WOSB and
        EDWOSB. We maintain compliance with FAR regulations and strive to
        ensure that all "t"s are crossed and "i"s are dotted!
      </br>
        We encourage your agency or representative to contact us for
        information about the science of non-verbal communication and how it
        impacts personnel, relationships, performance, and cultures within
        your agency.
      </br>
        Upon request, let’s discuss our company's past performance activities
        with federal agencies and current projects.
      </br>
        If you are another agency seeking potential partnership with a WOSB or
        EDWOSB, let us know! We value partnerships and look forward to growing
        America together one person at a time!
