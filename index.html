          <li>Do you go with your gut?</li>
          <li>Listen to that little voice?</li>
          <li>Smell something fishy?</li>

          These feelings are real and based on communication and relationships rooted in emotions and behaviors.
          We at Accountability Measures thoroughly understand this and have built our career on the science of non-verbal communication.
          The results: Better decisions. Improved communication. Positive outcomes.
          It's time for you to have the advantage!

      <p>"Body Language is the language of the soul and the self.  Change your
        body language ... Change your life.""Learn a foreign language ...
        Body Language."  - Dr. Donna Van Natten
      </p>

      <h2>Testimonials</h2>

      <p>This presentation was outstanding and the only time I can remember
        sitting in a class for two straight hours right before lunch and I
        still didn't want it to be over. Very useful, very entertaining and
        I am inspired to research more on the topic. -R.L.

        I was in attendance at the Women's Conference at Dyersburg, TN on
        April 7. I just want to thank you for the most amazing presentation
        I've heard, ever. I learned so much. As someone that's a survivor of
        domestic violence, (18 year marriage), it was so helpful to me in so
        many ways. I could have sat and listened to you all day. I'm sure you
        had so much more to share. Thank you again and keep ladies like us in
        mind.  -R.D

        In complete honesty, I was so impressed with Donna's direct style and
        her ability to empathize with the struggles of small business, that I
        actually asked Donna to visit my office later in the week. Within 30
        minutes, I had hired her for a 6 month contract and within two weeks,
        she had made a tremendous impact on my team, with particular focus on
        understanding communication styles, personal accountability and
        "real world" expectations. Donna has helped us develop and integrate
        an HR overhaul, discussed issues like dress code, getting along or
        moving along, varying personality types, self confidence and
        reliability. In fact, I've recently asked Donna to modify our contract
        to be "ongoing."   -C.D., Owner

        Dr. Van Natten: Just wanted to let you know it was great to meet you
        and to say that your presentation was delightful and informative today.
        Your keen observations and humerus approach made it not only
        informative  but really fun. I am a New Fan of yours.   -F.F.
