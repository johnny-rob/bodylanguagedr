            These feelings are real and based on communication and relationships rooted in emotions and behaviors.
            We at Accountability Measures thoroughly understand this and have built our career on the science of non-verbal communication.
            The results: Better decisions. Improved communication. Positive outcomes.
            It's time for you to have the advantage!  One size does not fit all! Your industry, relationships, culture, and challenges require a training process to meet your unique needs and expectations. While you're not blind as to "what's going on," neither are we!
            Our interpersonal approach allows us to communicate with your organization and you. Our approach is high-octane, interactive, visually stimulating, entertaining, motivational, and FUN!
            Offering an extensive range of professional services, you will become a savvy observer of yourself and others to "really" see what they are thinking and feeling.
            Plus, it's fascinating to learn how to read others!

            actually asked Donna to visit my office later in the week. Within 30

            "real world" expectations. Donna has helped us develop and integrate
            an HR overhaul, discussed issues like dress code, getting along or
            moving along, varying personality types, self confidence and
            reliability. In fact, I've recently asked Donna to modify our contract
